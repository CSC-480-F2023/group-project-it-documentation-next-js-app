# Project Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We commit to fostering a harassment-free environment for all community members. We embrace diversity, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We encourage an open-minded approach to changes and contributions.

## Our Standards

We encourage positive behavior, including:

- Showing empathy and kindness.
- Respecting differing opinions and experiences.
- Providing and receiving constructive feedback gracefully.
- Taking responsibility for and learning from mistakes.
- Prioritizing the community's well-being.
- Proposing ideas that include all community members.
- Ensuring everyone's ideas are heard and discussed.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Sexualized language or advances.
- Sabotaging or maliciously destroying contributed code.
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal attacks.
- Harassment, public or private.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit consent.
- Any behavior considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Repository leaders will enforce these standards and take appropriate corrective action against inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior. They have the authority to remove or reject contributions that violate this code of conduct.

## Enforcement

Violators will face the following actions:

1. **Correction**: Inappropriate behavior results in a private, written warning from community leaders, with the option for a public apology.

2. **Warning**: A warning is issued for a single incident or a series of actions, leading to no interactions with those enforcing the code of conduct for a specified period, including community and external spaces. Further violations may result in temporary or permanent bans.

3. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban is applied for a pattern of violations, including sustained inappropriate behavior, individual harassment, or aggression towards classes of individuals.
