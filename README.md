## Problem Statement

The Mercer University Information Technology Department currently lacks an efficient and user-friendly documentation platform. This leads to difficulties in accessing and updating documentation. The project's primary objective is to address this issue by creating a comprehensive documentation platform that allows for both Markdown and rich text editing. This will simplify content creation and accessibility for IT staff.

---

## Project Scope

### Version 1:

- Markdown editing support using MDX-React.
- Markdown rendering support for web pages.
- Minimalistic and user-friendly design.
- Utilizing NextJS as the framework for improved navigation.
- Support for imported files and directories for central documentation management.

### Version 2:

- Integration of a rich text editor (Quill) for user-friendly content creation.
- Conversion of rich text content to MDX documents for storage.
- Implementing a pathway for image uploads within the rich text editor.
- Organizing uploaded images into a subdirectory within the documentation directory to ensure image retention during directory movement.

## Technologies Used

We plan to use the following technologies for this project:

- **MDX-React:** For rendering Markdown as websites.
- **NextJS:** As the core framework for the documentation platform.
- **Quill:** As the rich text editor for version 2.
- **JavaScript and TypeScript:** For development.
- **Node.js:** For server-side development.
- **ReactJS:** For frontend development.
- **Linux/Windows Subsystem for Linux/MacOS:** Preferred operating systems for development.
- **Node Package Manager (NPM) and Node Package Executer (NPX):** Required for managing dependencies and executing scripts.

## Project Justification

The creation of the Mercer University IT Documentation Platform is highly relevant and valuable for the following reasons:

- **Efficient Documentation:** The platform will streamline documentation creation and management, making it easier for IT staff to document and access crucial information.

- **User-Friendly:** Version 2 with rich text editing will ensure that all staff members, regardless of their technical expertise, can contribute to and interact with documentation.

- **Centralization:** All documentation will be centralized, reducing the risk of data loss and making it simpler to manage and maintain.

- **Improved Navigation:** NextJS will enhance navigation, making it more user-friendly.

- **Retaining Images:** The subdirectory structure for images will ensure that image references are maintained during directory movement.

## Team Roles

- **Project Manager:** Overall project management, coordination, and communication with Mercer University IT Department.
- **Frontend Developer (You):** Implement the frontend components using NextJS, MDX-React, and Quill.
- **Backend Developer:** Develop the backend logic for content storage and retrieval.
- **UX/UI Designer:** Design the user interface for both versions, ensuring a minimalistic and user-friendly design.
